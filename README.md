Cooler sous vide
================

> Overkill is a way of life.

 -- Dave Craig

I've been using the sous vide technique from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's The
Food Lab (page 389).  If you're going to do sous vide without a
feedback controller, you might as well make a MCMC model and do really
good feedforward.
